v2024 = v1point1 on SNET

v2125_1

Fixed tab indices on UI.

Made the surge period (or the second item in periods) the default selection.

Inventory values default to 0 in custom inventory area.

Rounding capacity and fill to integers now for FlatChartData that makes sense.

Formatted SRC cells in FlatChartData to text to avoid sci notation.

*Note: more than one policy not working right now-mostly bc of % change *

Added 100% line, but this line won't change when chartdata is filtered.


v2125_2

Delete blank series and trendline from legend.

Set overlap of blank series back to 100%.

Only delete extra legend entries if they exist and only add a new blank series if
necessary.

added tables for bar charts.

On original TADMUDI chart, had to set the series values and names specifically now since
chart was looking funny with multiple periods.  Must have been caused by some red line
logic.

v2125_3

Not adding a dummy row at the end of chartdata anymore.

Fixed bar chart tables.

When setting series values specifically, end(xldown) was returning blank rows.  Accounted
for the case when there is only one record.

Added bar charts.

100% line is now green.

v2125_4

Always drawing 100% line now.

Moved 100% series behind policy bars so that you can hover over bars for info.

Changed Fonts to Arial and made bars 1 pt think on bar charts.

v2125_5

Limited chart production to 100 for now because that is max on my computer.

v2125_6

Fixed: When specifying your own inventory combo and adding it to the porfolio, the number of combos
in the portfolio was not being updated.

v2125_7
Wrote a new sheetToRecords function which doesn't depend on m3 tables.
For efficiency, now saving the peak demands to reuse.
-Most changes in simpleinterface.preparePercentageData and CraigUtils
-Added filterRecords to CraigUtils even though didn't use it...
Kept HideWindow because it's still slightly faster than loading the window again.

On SNET only
_____________________________
v2125_81
Imported 21-25 data

v2125_82
updated 20-24 capability groups to 21-25
_____________________________

v2125_9
added text to arrow.

For some reason 21-25 data on snet caused doubles instead of strings being sent to default0.
This was even if both 21-25 and 20-24 cells were both formatted as text. Both Excel 2013.
Windows 10 on NIPR though and Windows 7 on SNET. Both application.Version were 11.
Fix: default0 should just check to see if the value isempty instead of a string.

formatted data cells of capacity and fill columns to number with 0 decimal places.

v2125_10
needed to clear peaks wks before outputting new peaks. Change in getPercentage data

When we were calling getPeakBetween, we were calling sortAny on a collection of strings.
This sort would place "1901" before "27", so PostSurge fromTime was always < the first
string in this sorted collection and the peak was initialized at 0 at the beginning of 
the period when it should have been 1.  < does seem to work with strings and numbers.
Change in getPeakBetween and something below.

v2125_11
Demands with 0 quantity were being created with a quantity of 1 per createDemand in
TimeStep_EntityFactory.  Changed to use .quantity if quantity >= 0. Otherwise,
throw an exception.

VBA Round was rounding to nearest even number with .5.  Switched rounding on 
combined capacity and fill to Application.WorksheetFunction.Round to reflect standard
rounding expectations.
Now, sparkcharts and TADMUDI match for the testdata and 2125 data on SNET.

Added Excel 2013 requirement MsgBox to ThisWorkbook.

v2125_12
If a unit's supplyrecord has a different policy, need to use that. Name after policy
in supplyrecords.  wait a minute, how do sparkchart results match tadmudi then?
ohhh. sparkcharts aren't using supply policies either... verify.
