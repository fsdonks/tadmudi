v2024 = v1point1 on SNET

v2125_1

Fixed tab indices on UI.

Made the surge period (or the second item in periods) the default selection.

Inventory values default to 0 in custom inventory area.

Rounding capacity and fill to integers now for FlatChartData that makes sense.

Formatted SRC cells in FlatChartData to text to avoid sci notation.

*Note: more than one policy not working right now-mostly bc of % change *

Added 100% line, but this line won't change when chartdata is filtered.


v2125_2

Delete blank series and trendline from legend.

Set overlap of blank series back to 100%.

Only delete extra legend entries if they exist and only add a new blank series if
necessary.

added tables for bar charts.

On original TADMUDI chart, had to set the series values and names specifically now since
chart was looking funny with multiple periods.  Must have been caused by some red line
logic.

v2125_3

Not adding a dummy row at the end of chartdata anymore.

Fixed bar chart tables.

When setting series values specifically, end(xldown) was returning blank rows.  Accounted
for the case when there is only one record.

Added bar charts.

100% line is now green.

v2125_4

Always drawing 100% line now.

Moved 100% series behind policy bars so that you can hover over bars for info.

Changed Fonts to Arial and made bars 1 pt think on bar charts.

v2125_5

Limited chart production to 100 for now because that is max on my computer.

v2125_6

Fixed: When specifying your own inventory combo and adding it to the porfolio, the number of combos
in the portfolio was not being updated.

v2125_7
Wrote a new sheetToRecords function which doesn't depend on m3 tables.
For efficiency, now saving the peak demands to reuse.
-Most changes in simpleinterface.preparePercentageData and CraigUtils
-Added filterRecords to CraigUtils even though didn't use it...
Kept HideWindow because it's still slightly faster than loading the window again.
